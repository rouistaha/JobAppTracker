## AI Contributions
AI was used throughout the project as a support tool to accelerate development and resolve specific challenges. Specifically, AI assisted in:

- Writing Angular components, services, and dialog forms.
- Designing responsive UI layouts using PrimeNG and PrimeFlex.
- Implementing calendar view, table view, and reactive updates.
- Writing chart data structures for the statistics dashboard and ensuring live updates.
- Generating consistent and professional SCSS styles.
- Debugging npm and Angular build errors, including dependency and deployment issues.

While AI provided guidance and code snippets, all modifications, custom logic, and final integration were reviewed, adapted, and implemented manually to fit the project’s needs.
